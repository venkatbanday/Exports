# Exports

**Exports**

Containers are exported to various countries, and ocean freight quotes are obtained from a single forwarder, which includes 14 free days at the destination. The consignee is responsible for the goods within these standard free days. Any additional costs incurred after the free days are added to the ocean freight.

**Steps Taken:**

1. Informed the Sales Team to include the freight cost with standard free days in the contract. If there are any additional costs, the difference in freight will be recovered through a debit note.
2. Quotation requests are forwarded to liners/forwarders with the standard free days unless the buyer has special requirements for additional free days.
3. A cost comparison chart is prepared for every requirement.
4. Finalised the lowest quote.
5. Upon comparing the ocean freight costs from previous years to the present, we found substantial differences that resulted in increased profits for the company.
